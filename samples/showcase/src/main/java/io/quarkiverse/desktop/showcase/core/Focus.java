/**
 * Brings a showcase window to the front and makes sure it really is the focused window of the desktop, for the pages
 * that need the focus ({@link FeaturePage#needsFocus()}).
 * <p>
 * Each attempt asks for the focus ({@code toFront}, {@code requestFocus}) and waits for the window to be focused while
 * this process owns the foreground ({@link Foreground}). Windows refuses the foreground to a background process when
 * another process received the last input (for instance another showcase process that just released the focus lock) :
 * the later attempts then click the title bar of a decorated window of the showcase, as a user would (a click
 * activates the window it lands on), only after checking that the window under the point belongs to this process, and
 * the mouse pointer is moved back. When the windows of another process cover every title bar (the application in front
 * of a user's desktop), the window is first raised above them without being activated (always on top, then not). Bounded
 * : {@link #MAX_ATTEMPTS} attempts.
 * <p>
 * The title bar click is Windows only : {@link Foreground} knows the foreground there only. On Linux and macOS the Java
 * focus state is trusted and each attempt is {@code toFront} and {@code requestFocus}. On X11 they ask the window
 * manager to activate the window (_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW) : the Docker window manager of the showcase has no mouse
 * bindings, a click would activate nothing there, and without a window manager a frame has no title bar at all. On
 * macOS, AWT never activates the application and rejects the focus requests of an inactive one : with
 * {@code -Dshowcase.activate=true} (unattended runs only, such as CI : on a user's desktop it would take the focus from
 * the active application), each attempt first activates the application ({@code Desktop.requestForeground}), and the
 * later attempts click the title bar on macOS too (a mouse click activates the application), without the check of the
 * window under the point that only Windows can make.
 * <p>
 * A window is also placed asynchronously : {@link #awaitPlaced} waits until its screen location, as AWT knows it, is the
 * requested one (X11 reports a location after the focus, sometimes) before Robot coordinates are computed from it.
